## Overview

Creates a game of Minewalker, in which you have to get from start to end, trying not to blow up and trying to take the shortest path possible. Has customizable size and cheats to help learn the game.

## Compiling and Using

You'll need to compile Minewalker.java and then run the class file. The slider is used to change the size, and the New Game button is always there to reset.

## Discussion

There were plenty of errors, whether it be with changing the grid size, generating a working and stable path that could be shown and hidden flawlessly, and organizing everything the correct way.

## Testing

I played it multiple times with multiple sizes to make sure it would run well and correctly every time.
